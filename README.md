# What

This is a public issue tracker of the [NativeConnect for Mac](https://nativeconnect.app/).

# Why

App Store Connect is a heavy portal used for many different workflows, most of which would naturally fit into our professional Xcode-grade user interface.

So we are keen to get more feedback from new customers and decide on the most important features for the future development.

Please help us to improve the app, thanks in advance!
